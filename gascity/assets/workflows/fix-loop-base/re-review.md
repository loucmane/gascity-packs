This is the `fix-loop-base` methodology contract re-review step.

Concrete methodology packs override this step to call `{{code_review_formula}}`
after fixes. Continue only while the iteration count is below
`{{max_iterations}}`. Record the follow-up review report path on workflow root
metadata as `gc.build.review_report_path` before closing.

Artifact validation: the controller executes the authoritative validation gate from the controller-stamped absolute `gc.check_path`, which validates the report recorded at `gc.build.review_report_path` against schema `gc.build.review.v1`. Do not run this validator from the worker; the controller records failures in `gc.attempt_log` for the bounded retry. On repair attempts (`gc.attempt` greater than 1), read the validator errors from `gc.attempt_log` on the validation loop control bead (the dependent of this step bead) and repair the report in place instead of rewriting it. Two bounded repair attempts follow the first failure; exhausting them closes this stage with `gc.outcome=fail` and machine-readable validation errors that block downstream stages. Never ask questions in headless mode; record unresolved ambiguity inside the report.
